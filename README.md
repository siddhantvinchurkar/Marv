# Marv
Artificial Intelligence Personified

Marv is your artificially intelligent personal digital assistant.

From opening apps to calculating complex math problems - Marv has got it all covered! He can define words, give you weather updates, tell you how far away a place is or help you choose a good movie to watch over the weekend.
Marv uses speech recognition technology to do what you want him to do. This makes him extremely easy to use.
Marv is powered by a very powerful AI engine. This engine can answer pretty much any logical question that you throw at Marv.
Feedback is much appreciated.

P.S. Marv is still under development. He uses the default voice from your text to speech software to speak. So don't be surprised if he has a female voice! Also Marv is built for Android M but permissions have not been handled yet. You will have to manually grant permissions for Marv to run correctly.
